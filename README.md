# NeuralNetwork-Scene-Change-Detection-Model

**Robotic Vision Scene Understanding Challenge**

Abstract:

As part of this project, I attempted solving scene change detection task from **“The Robotic vision scene understanding challenge”** hosted by Australian Center for Robotic Vision. 
A simulation environment was constructed using Gazebo and a model robot was created using Robot Operating System 2. 
A pretrained 3D convolutional neural network based solution is proposed to detect the changes. 
The robot was moved in different types of paths and generated video of the environment. 
These video files are used to train the model to understand the scene and detect any changes.
